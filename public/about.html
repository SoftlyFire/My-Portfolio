<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Nancy and this is my personal portfolio. I am self-taught using instructional programs such as Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp course, Udemy's Canva Social Media Content Creation Beginner to Advanced. For my fundamentals in Programming and just to have a more thorough knowledge of Computers,  I am taking Harvard's EdX program of CS50 Intro to Computer Science and hopefully up next will be Harvard's Intro to Programming with Python. I continually practice my skills on FreeCodeCamp and of course the projects that I am currently working on.  </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy what you see. It has been a journey learning the self-taught route (also with the help of Youtube videos) and defintely would'nt change it for anything. I am a believer in that we never stop learning as there is always space for improvement. Thank you.</p>
